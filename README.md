Git seems complicated but when you work thru it, it seems easy to work with.

Steps to update your repo from your local machine:

create a folder where you like to repo and make it your current directory (cd ...)

clone with SSH or HTTP keys from terminal

once you see the copy of your repo (clone under your current directory), modify as needed

git add .  to apply the change to your repo

git commit 

git push

git pull

(for others to see the change they gotta pull)
